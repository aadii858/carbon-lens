## 💡 The Vision
Climate change feels abstract. We buy a burger or drive a car, but we never see the **"Carbon Shadow"** attached to those actions. 

**Carbon Lens** changes that. We built an AI-powered mirror that reveals the hidden environmental cost of your daily choices in real-time, helping you make better decisions through positive reinforcement and gamification.

* **Calculates:** Estimates the Carbon Footprint score (0-100).
* **Nudges:** Suggests eco-friendly alternatives instantly.

### 2. 🕶️ AR "Lens" Mode
A visual "Terminator-style" HUD that overlays sustainability data onto the real world using the camera feed.

### 3. 🚶 Smart Travel Tracker
* **Walk/Cycle:** Earn Planet Points 🌿
* **Car/Drive:** Track your Carbon Debt 🚗

### 4. 🎮 Gamified Ecology
* **Planet Points:** Earn points for low-carbon choices.
